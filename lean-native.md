# Lean Native

## Summary

- Don't build until you validate


## Why Do Products Fail?

 |                     Reason                     | Risk Type |
 | ---------------------------------------------: | :-------- |
 |                    Fixing non-existent problem | Problem   |
 | Failure to understand consumer needs and wants | Solution  |
 |                     Targeting the wrong market | Channel   |


## Lean Analytics

- Validate hypothesis
- Actionable framework for stages


## Lean Lifecycle

### Pre-build
    
- Measure
    - **Validate problem**
        - Demographic: painful and (frequently) reoccurring problem
            - Frequency affects ability to iterate
            - If not painful enough, then not monetizable
                - People's self ratings: a 7-8 is really a 9-10
        - Output: filter criteria for demographic
    - **Validate solution**
        - Goal: Identify key features
            - Create quick interactive mocks
                - Sketch
                - WebFlow
            - Validate someone **else**'s solution
                - Wally
        - Metrics
            - Enthusiasm level for 4/5 people 9+/10 (if 4+ interviewers see a 9+/10 response)
            - Bonus: referrals
            - Bonus: writing a check
            - Consider filter criteria for each person interviewed
        - Outputs
            - Key demographics
    - **Validate channel**
        - Channels
            - Some cost money (FB ads)
            - Some take people (trade shows)
            - Some take time (SEO and content marketing)
        - Can you acquire your first 100-1,000 users through this channel at a reasonable cost?
            - Getting to 1,000,000 would likely require different channels
- User interviews
    - Use [lookback.io](lookback.io) (see user expression while also their screen)

### MVP

- Product
    - Reach metrics
    - Minimum
        - Only 1-2 core features
        - No bells or whistles
    - Viable
        - Solves the core problem for your **target demographic**
    - Product
        - Not fake
        - Not throwaway
    - Native VS Web?
        - Do your 1-2 core features or target demographic **require** Native?
            - nstudio.io/xplat
            - nativescript/schemantics
- Early Adopters
    - Find 20 die hard fans
    - High rate of feedback
    - People who feel the pain so bad, they're willing to work with you
- Validating Acquisition
    - Determine *Customer Acquisition Cost* (get *new* users) for top few channels
    - Determine *Lifetime Value* (LTV) for users (or "potential LTV" if product is free)
    - Track these over time, per demographic. Example: cheaper CAC in July than September
    - Get LTV:CAC ratio to 2+:1

### Growth

- Channel Optimization
    - Throw $ at your channel (only works if 3:1 for LTV:CAC)
- Acquisition Loops
    - Basic example
        1. New user
        1. Tell friends
        1. Builds network
        1. Repeat
    - Loops lead to exponential interest
- Retention Loops
    - Example: "Someone comments on your post"
    - Time, location, change, peer, programmatic
