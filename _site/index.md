# JS Mobile Conf Notes

Host: [Progress Software](https://www.progress.com/) ([my notes](./progress.md))

> "[jsMobileConf](https://jsmobileconf.com/) is a two-day, two-track, developer event focused on mobility and the cutting-edge JavaScript ecosystem."


## TakeAways

- If you need benefits of binary, there are tons of tools to make it less "scary"
- If native is important, use **NativeScript or React Native**
- **ML Kit + Firebase** makes intro to ML easy
- **FaaS is just GCP Cloud Functions**: make 'em simple and pure
- Save $$ by moving **static assets to CDN** and route APIs to FaaS
- Many tools exist for handling various **offline** scenarios, but conflict resolution is hard (do it at data store layer)
- Use **[gethuman.com](https://gethuman.com)** to skip wait times at call centers
- For lean app SDLC, focus on real product with only core features (test and iterate!)
- Guide the direction of JS: It's easy and cheap to **become a member of Ecma**
