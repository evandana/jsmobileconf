### Impact of standards

- Effective communication
- Interoperability
- Problem solving
- Value capture
- Tech adoption
- Regulation

### What gets standardized?

- Business processes
- Processes
- Vocabulary
- Frameworks
- Interfaces
- Data formats

### What makes a good standard?

- Technical description
    - How easily can it be read?
    - What other specs does it cite?
    - Example of good spec: ECMA Spec
    - W3C Spec looking to improve
- IP Policy
    - Does it even have one?
    - What are the terms?
- Issuing Authority
    - What kind of organization is it?
    - Where is it incorporated?
    - Where & how do they publish their standards?

## Ecma

Ecma [r/starterpack](https://www.reddit.com/r/starterpack)

- Organization
    - ~12 Active technical committees
    - ~34 Members
- How to join?
    - Email the secretariat


## Types of standards

- An issuing authority may publish multiple types of standards
    - Prorietary (aka "closed")
    - De Facto (aka "community", e.g. Node's standard)
        - Problem: often controlled by single vendor and might not change based on community needs
    - De Jure (aka "formal", e.g. Ecma, ISO)
    - Voluntary consensus
- What makes a standard "open"?
    - Openness of participation (can everyone participate?)
    - Consensus agreement (no domination)
    - Due process (balloting or appeals process)
    - "One world" (same everwhere or regional)
    - Open IPR (low or no charge)
    - Open access to documents (access to current and old)
    - Open change process (can people propose change)
    - Open interfaces (support backwards compatible)
    - Objective conformance mechanism
    - Ongoing support

## How open is JavaScript

- Open membership, but paid
- Consensus-seeking decision making
- Improved tooling
    - Moved process to GitHub to allow viewing and collaboration
- Worldwide standard
- Royalty-free IP
- Free to view/download
    - They will print and mail it if you want
- Test262 - test suite
- Improvements to process, access to archival material


## Brief History of JS

- 25 years old
- Born of a competitive move against NetScape
- Tried to take to W3C, but they denied it
- Ecma said yes, in 1996
    - First published in 1997

## Proposal Process

1. Idea
    - Is it interesting?
1. Proposal
    - High-level discussions and challenges
1. Draft
    - Draft spec text and precise syntax
    - Consider how to test
1. Candidate
    - Refinement
    - Feedback
    - Testing
1. Finished
    - Criteria met
    - Tests are in
    - Editors signed off

### Publication Process

- In-person meetings
    - 6 per year
- November feature freeze
- Spec text polish

## Current: ES9 == ECMA2018
