Shiva Prasad


## When to use: **If/else would be too compled**

- When you can't code the rules
- When you can't scale


## Paths

- Learn machine learning
    - [Video](bit.ly/ml-step-1)
    - [Coursera course](bit.ly/ml-step-1)
- Use machine learning
    - BigML
    - Watson
    - Azure Machine Learning
    - Amazon Machine Learning

## [Demo](https://github.com/shiv19/nativescript-tfjs-sample)

- See the demo link ^
- Starting off...
    - `global.setImmediate`, etc...
    - `global.process = { versions: { node: '10.0' }}`
- Video machine learning
    - Take snapshots at interval
    - Use like regular image processing ML
- Text recognition with ML Kit
